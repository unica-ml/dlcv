## Course objectives and outcomes

**Objectives**: to provide students with the fundamental elements of deep learning, demonstrate its application to computer vision, and form practical skills in implementing and using deep-learning-based systems. 

**Outcome**: An understanding of fundamental concepts and methods of deep learning and its applications, focusing on computer vision, paired with a set of tools and skills required for realizing functioning deep-learning systems.

**Required skills**

The course will also give the basis to understand the fundamental concepts of machine learning, so knowing them is recommended but optional.

## Course Outline

1. Introduction to Machine Learning and Deep Learning (2 hours)
2. Data Representation with Tensors (2 hours)
3. Learning from Tensors: Gradient Descent and Backpropagation (4 hours)
4. Using a Deep Neural Network to Learn from Data (2 hours)
5. Designing and Improving Deep-learning Models for classification (3 hours)
6. Real-Time Object Detection with YOLO (3 hours)
7. Running Scientific Experiments with PyTorch (4 hours)

## Assessment

**For MSc Students**

The students can decide to take the exam in one of the following two formats (either one or the other):

* 1 CFU - written examination
* 2 CFU - development of a project in teams (max 3 people in each group)

**For PhD Students**
